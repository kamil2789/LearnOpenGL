1. Everything in OpenGL is in 3D space
2. What is GLFW? Graphic Library Framework. It provides programmers with the ability to create and manage windows and OpenGL contexts, as well as handle joystick, keyboard and mouse input.
3. GLAD - Since there are many different versions of
OpenGL drivers, the location of most of its functions is not known at compile-time and needs to be
queried at run-time
4. Always first include GLAD because this lib create handlers to openGL functions
5. Graphic pipeline in openGL has 6 steps. All of these steps are highly specialized (they have one specific function) and can easily be executed in parallel.
6. Vertex Data[] -> 1. Vertex Shader -> 2. Shape Assemply -> 3. Geometry Shader -> 4. Rasterization -> 5. Fragment Shader -> 6. Test and Blending
7. Clipping is a stage in the graphics pipeline that determines which primitives to discard and which ones to pass through to the next stag
8. Normalized device coordinates: -1 to 1
